\begin{xca}
  Prove Lemma 3.9 (Unambiguous Expressions)
\end{xca}
\begin{prf}
  Let $\rx R$ and $\rx S$ be regular expressions producing $\rl R$ and $\rl S$.
  Proceed by cases.

  If $\rx R = \varepsilon$, 0, or 1, then $\rl R = \{\varepsilon\}$, $\{0\}$, or $\{1\}$.
  Notice each is produced exactly once, so $\rx R$ is unambiguous.

  Now, suppose $\rx R$ and $\rx S$ are unambiguous.
  We proceed by contrapositives.

  Suppose $\rx R \smile \rx S$ which produces $\rl R \cup \rl S$ is ambiguous.
  Then, since $\rx R$ and $\rx S$ are unambiguous,
  the union operation must produce a duplicate.
  That is, $\rl R \cap \rl S \neq \varnothing$.
  Conversely, if $\rl R \cap \rl S$ is non-empty,
  then whatever expressions are in the intersection are produced twice by $\rx R \smile \rx S$.
  Therefore, $\rx R \smile \rx S$ is ambiguous if and only if $\rl R \cap \rl S \neq \varnothing$.

  Suppose $\rx R\rx S$ is ambiguous.
  Then, $\rl R \rl S = \{\rho\sigma : \rho \in \rl R, \sigma \in \rl S\}$
  produces some element $\rho\sigma = \rho'\sigma'$ twice.
  Notice that for all $(\rho,\sigma) \in \rl R \times \rl S$, $f(\rho,\sigma) = \rho\sigma \in \rl R \rl S$.
  That is, $\abs{\rl R \times \rl S} \geq \abs{\rl R \rl S}$.
  However, since $\rho\sigma = \rho'\sigma'$, $f$ is not injective.
  Therefore, $\abs{\rl R \times \rl S} \neq \abs{\rl R \rl S}$.
  This means $\rl R\times\rl S \mathrel{\not\bijects} \rl R\rl S$.

  Conversely, suppose $\rl R\times\rl S \mathrel{\not\bijects} \rl R\rl S$.
  Then, $\abs{\rl R \times \rl S} > \abs{\rl R \rl S}$.
  This means that under $f$, multiple pairs must be sent to one string,
  which is exactly what it means for $\rl R\rl S$ to be ambiguous.

  Finally, consider $\rx R^*$ is ambiguous.
  Then, since $\rx R$ is unambiguous, the ambiguity must be introduced
  by either a single $\rx R^k$ being ambiguous or the union.
  By induction on the second point, the union is unambiguous if and only if
  $\bigcup_{k=0}^\infty \rl R^k$ is a disjoint union.
  Therefore, $\rx R^*$ is ambiguous if and only if all the $\rx R^k$ are unambiguous
  and the union of the $\rl R^k$ is disjoint.
\end{prf}

\begin{xca}
  Let $\rx A = (10 \smile 101)$ and $\rx B = (001 \smile 100 \smile 1001)$.
  For each of $\rx{AB}$ and $\rx{BA}$, is the expression unambiguous?
  What is the generating series (by length) of the set it produces?
\end{xca}
\begin{sol}
  Write out $\rl{AB} = \{10001, 10100, 101001, 101001, 101100, 1011001\}$.
  Notice $101001$ appears twice, so $\rx{AB}$ is ambiguous.
  The (meaningless) generating series is $2x^5 + 2x^6 + x^7$.

  Write out $\rl{BA} = \{00110, 001101, 10010, 100101, 100110, 1001101\}$.
  No element appeared twice, so $\rx{BA}$ is unambiguous.
  The generating series is $2x^5 + 2x^6 + x^7$.
\end{sol}

\begin{xca}
  Let $\rx A = (00 \smile 101 \smile 11)$ and $\rx B = (00 \smile 001 \smile 10 \smile 110)$.
  Prove that $\rx A^*$ is unambiguous and $\rx B^*$ is ambiguous.
  Find the generating series (by length) for the set $\rl A^*$ produced by $\rx A^*$.
\end{xca}
\begin{sol}
  Notice that $\rx A$ is unambiguous.
  There is no way to combine any two of the three strings to create the other one:
  creating 00 from 101 and 11 is clearly impossible;
  11 from 00 and 101 can only be made by 101101 but 10 and 01 cannot be made by 00;
  101 cannot be made from 00 and 11 since there is no single 0.
  Therefore, $\rx A^*$ is unambiguous.

  For $\rx B$, notice that $00110 = (001)(10) = (00)(110)$, so it is ambiguous.

  By Theorem 3.13, $\Phi_{\rl A^*} = (A^*)(x) = \frac{1}{1-A(x)} = \frac{1}{1-2x^2-x^3}$.
\end{sol}

\begin{xca}
  For each of the following sets of binary strings,
  write an unambiguous expression which produces that set.
\end{xca}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Binary strings that have no block of 0's of size 3,
        and no block of 1's of size 2.
        \begin{sol}
          A valid block of 0's is matched by $0 \smile 00 \smile 00000^*$.
          Likewise, a valid block of 1's is $1 \smile 1111^*$.
          Then, the block decomposition is
          \[
            \rx R = (\varepsilon \smile 0 \smile 0^2 \smile 0^40^*)
            ((1\smile 1^31^*)(0 \smile 0^2 \smile 0^40^*))^*
            (\varepsilon \smile 1 \smile 1^31^*)
          \]
          which is, as a block decomposition, unambiguous.
        \end{sol}
  \item Binary strings that have no substring of 0's of length 3,
        and no substring of 1's of length 2.
        \begin{sol}
          This means blocks of 0's have length 1 or 2, i.e., $(0 \smile 00)$
          and blocks of 1's have length 1, i.e., $(1)$.
          Then, the block decomposition is
          \[
            \rx R = (\varepsilon \smile 0 \smile 00)(1(0 \smile 00))^*(\varepsilon \smile 1)
          \]
          which an unambiguous block decomposition.
        \end{sol}
  \item Binary strings in which the substring 011 does not occur.
        \begin{sol}
          There are no ways that 011 overlaps itself.
          Therefore, we need only force blocks of 1's after a 0 to have length 1.
          Using a block decomposition depending if we start with 1 or 0,
          \[
            \rx R = \varepsilon \smile (1 1^*)(0 0^* 1)^*0^* \smile (00^*)(1 00^*)^*(\varepsilon \smile 1)
          \]
          which is unambiguous.
        \end{sol}
  \item Binary strings in which the blocks of 0's have even length and
        the blocks of 1's have odd length.
        \begin{sol}
          Blocks of 0's are matched by $00(00)^*$ and 1's by $1(11)^*$. Then,
          \[
            (00)^*(1(11)^*00(00)^*)^*(\varepsilon \smile 1(11)^*)
          \]
          is an unambiguous block decomposition.
        \end{sol}
\end{enumerate}

\begin{xca}
  Let $\rx G = 0^*((11)^*1(00)^*00 \smile (11)^*11(00)^*0)^*$,
  and let $\rl G$ be the set of binary strings produced by $\rx G$.
\end{xca}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Give a verbal description of the strings in the set $\rl G$.
        \begin{sol}
          The set of binary strings where blocks of 0's
          have the opposite parity of the preceding block of 1's.
        \end{sol}
  \item Find the generating series (by length) of $\rl G$.
        \begin{sol}
          We know by Theorem 3.13 $\Phi_{\rl G}(x) = G(x)$, so
          \begin{align*}
            \Phi_{\rl G}(x)
             & = \frac{1}{1-x}\cdot\frac{1}{1-\qty(\frac{x}{1-x^2}\cdot\frac{x^2}{1-x^2} + \frac{x^2}{1-x^2}\cdot\frac{x}{1-x^2})} \\
             & = \frac{1}{1-x}\cdot\frac{1}{1-\frac{2x^3}{(1-x^2)^2}}                                                              \\
             & = \frac{1}{1-x}\cdot\frac{(1-x^2)^2}{(1-x^2)^2-2x^3}                                                                \\
             & = \frac{(1+x)(1-x^2)}{1-2x^2-2x^3+x^4}                                                                              \\
             & = \frac{1+x-x^2-x^3}{1-2x^2-2x^3+x^4}
          \end{align*}
          as desired.
        \end{sol}
  \item For $n \in \N$, let $g_n$ be the number of strings in $\rl G$ of length $n$.
        Give a recurrence relation and enough initial conditions
        to uniquely determine $g_n$ for all $n \in \N$.
        \begin{sol}
          Apply Theorem 4.8 and read off the linear recurrence relation:
          \[
            g_n - 2g_{n-2} - 2g_{n-3} + g_{n-4} = \begin{cases}
              1  & n = 0    \\
              1  & n = 1    \\
              -1 & n = 2    \\
              -1 & n = 3    \\
              0  & n \geq 4
            \end{cases}
          \]
          from which we calculate initial conditions $g_0 = 1$,
          $g_1 = 1$, $g_2 = 2g_0 - 1 = 1$, $g_3 = 2g_1 + 2g_0 - 1 = 3$.
        \end{sol}
\end{enumerate}

\begin{xca}\end{xca}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Show that the generating series (by length) for binary strings
        in which every block of 0's has length at least 2
        and every block of 1's has length at least 3 is $\frac{(1-x+x^3)(1-x+x^2)}{1-2x+x^2-x^5}$.
        \begin{sol}
          This set of strings is produced by
          $\rx R = (\varepsilon \smile 000^*)(1111^*000^*)^*(\varepsilon \smile 1111^*)$.
          This leads to the rational function
          \begin{align*}
            R(x)
             & = \qty(1 + \frac{x^2}{1-x})\frac{1}{1-(\frac{x^3}{1-x}\cdot\frac{x^2}{1-x})}\qty(1 + \frac{x^3}{1-x}) \\
             & = \frac{1-x+x^2}{1-x}\cdot\frac{1}{1-\frac{x^5}{(1-x)^2}}\cdot\frac{1-x+x^3}{1-x}                     \\
             & = \frac{(1-x+x^2)(1-x+x^3)}{(1-x)^2}\cdot\frac{(1-x)^2}{(1-x)^2-x^5}                                  \\
             & = \frac{(1-x+x^2)(1-x+x^3)}{1-2x+x^2-x^5}
          \end{align*}
          which is equal to the generating series by Theorem 3.13.
        \end{sol}
  \item Give a recurrence relation and enough initial conditions to
        determine the coefficients of this power series.
        \begin{sol}
          Expand the numerator to get $\Phi_{\rl R}(x) = \frac{1-2x+2x^2-x^4+x^5}{1-2x+x^2-x^5}$.
          Then, apply Theorem 4.8 to read off the linear recurrence relation:
          \[
            r_n - 2r_{n-1} + r_{n-2} - r_{n-5} = \begin{cases}
              1  & n = 0    \\
              -2 & n = 1    \\
              2  & n = 2    \\
              0  & n = 3    \\
              -1 & n = 4    \\
              1  & n = 5    \\
              0  & n \geq 6
            \end{cases}
          \]
          and calculate $r_0 = 1$, $r_1 = -2 + 2r_0 = 0$,
          $r_2 = 2 + 2r_1 - r_0 = 1$, $r_3 = 0 + 2r_2 - r_1 = 2$,
          $r_4 = -1 + 2r_3 - r_2 = 2$, and $r_5 = 1 + 2r_4 - r_3 + r_0 = 4$.
        \end{sol}
\end{enumerate}

\begin{xca}\end{xca}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item For $n \in \N$, let $h_n$ be the number of binary strings of length $n$
        such that each even-length block of 0's is followed by a block of exactly one 1
        and each odd-length block of 0's is followed by a block of exactly two 1's.
        Show that $h_n = [x^n]\frac{1+x}{1-x^2-2x^3}$.
        \begin{sol}
          Let $\rl H$ be the relevant set and notice it is produced by
          the block decomposition $\rx H = 1^*(00(00)^*1 \smile 0(00)^*11)$.
          Note that since a block of 0's is followed by a block of 1's, we must end on a block of 1's.
          By Theorem 3.11, $\Phi_{\rl H}(x) = H(x)$ which is
          \begin{align*}
            H(x)
             & = \frac{1}{1-x}\cdot\frac{1}{1-(\frac{x^3}{1-x^2} + \frac{x^3}{1-x^2})} \\
             & = \frac{1}{1-x}\cdot\frac{1-x^2}{1-x^2-2x^3}                            \\
             & = \frac{1+x}{1-x^2-2x^3}
          \end{align*}
          and $h_n = [x^n]H(x)$ by Proposition 2.7, as desired.
        \end{sol}
  \item Give a recurrence relation and enough initial conditions to
        determine $h_n$ for all $n \in \N$.
        \begin{sol}
          Again, read off a recurrence relation from $H(x)$ by Theorem 4.8:
          \[
            h_n - h_{n-2} - 2h_{n-3} = \begin{cases}
              1 & n = 0    \\
              1 & n = 1    \\
              0 & n \geq 2
            \end{cases}
          \]
          and calculate $h_0 = 1$, $h_1 = 1$, $h_2 = 0 + h_0 = 1$,
          and $h_3 = 0 + h_1 + 2h_0 = 3$.
        \end{sol}
\end{enumerate}

\begin{xca}
  Let $\rl K$ be the set of binary strings in which any block of 1's
  which immediately follows a block of 0's must have length at least
  as great as the length of that block of 0's.
\end{xca}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Derive a formula for $K(x) = \sum_{\kappa \in \rl K} x^{\ell(\kappa)}$.
        \begin{sol}
          First, we recursively define $\rx L = 11^* \smile 0\rx L 1$
          so that $\rl L = 0^i 1^j$ where $j \geq i \geq 1$ which is unambiguous.
          Now, define $\rx K = 1^*\rx L^* 0^*$ as a block decomposition.

          We can now calculate $L(x) = \frac{x}{1-x} + x^2L(x)$
          so $L(x) = \frac{x}{(1-x)(1-x^2)}$. Then,
          \begin{align*}
            K(x)
             & = \frac{1}{1-x}\cdot\frac{1}{1-\frac{x}{(1-x)(1-x^2)}}\cdot\frac{1}{1-x} \\
             & = \frac{1}{(1-x)^2}\cdot\frac{(1-x)(1-x^2)}{(1-x)(1-x^2)-x}              \\
             & = \frac{1+x}{1-2x-x^2+x^3}
          \end{align*}
          which is the generating series $\Phi_{\rl K}(x)$ by Theorem 3.11.
        \end{sol}
  \item Give a recurrence relation and enough initial conditions to
        determine the coefficients $[x^n]K(x)$ for all $n \in \N$.
        \begin{sol}
          Let $k_n = [x^n]K(x)$. By Theorem 4.8, we have the recurrence relation
          \[
            k_n - 2k_{n-1} - k_{n-2} + k_{n-3} = \begin{cases}
              1 & n = 0    \\
              1 & n = 1    \\
              0 & n \geq 2
            \end{cases}
          \]
          and calculate $k_0 = 1$, $k_1 = 1 + 2k_0 = 3$,
          and $k_2 = 0 + 2k_1 + k_0 = 7$.
        \end{sol}
\end{enumerate}

\begin{xca}\end{xca}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Fix an integer $m \geq 1$.
        Find the generating series (by length) of the set of binary strings
        in which no block has length greater than $m$.
        \begin{sol}
          Blocks of 0's and 1's become $\smilesum_{i=1}^m 0^i$
          and $\smilesum_{i=1}^m 1^i$.
          Then, the block decomposition
          \[
            \rx R = (\smilesum_{i=0}^m 0^i)
            (\smilesum_{i=1}^m 1^i\smilesum_{i=1}^m 0^i)^*
            (\smilesum_{i=0}^m 1^i)
          \]
          produces our desired set.
          By Theorem 3.11, the generating series $\Phi_{\rl R}(x) = R(x)$ which is
          \begin{align*}
            R(x)
             & = \qty(\sum_{i=0}^m x^i)\qty(\frac{1}{1-(\sum_{i=1}^m x^i)^2})\qty(\sum_{i=0}^m x^i) \\
             & = \qty(\frac{1-x^{m+1}}{1-x})^2\qty(\frac{1}{1-(\frac{x-x^{m+1}}{1-x})^2})           \\
             & = \frac{(1-x^{m+1})^2}{(1-x)^2}\cdot\frac{(1-x)^2}{(1-x)^2-(x-x^{m+1})^2}            \\
             & = \frac{(1-x^{m+1})^2}{(1-x)^2-(x-x^{m+1})^2}
          \end{align*}
          which I'm sure simplifies further.
        \end{sol}
  \item Fix integers $m, k \geq 1$.
        Find the generating series (by length) of the set of binary strings
        in which no block of 0's has length greater than $m$
        and no block of 1's has length greater than $k$.
        \begin{sol}
          Proceed as above: we instead get the block decomposition
          \[
            \rx R = (\smilesum_{i=0}^m 0^i)
            (\smilesum_{i=1}^k 1^i\smilesum_{i=1}^m 0^i)^*
            (\smilesum_{i=0}^k 1^i)
          \]
          which produces the set we want. By Theorem 3.11,
          \begin{align*}
            \Phi_{\rl R}(x)
             & = R(x)                                                                                                                   \\
             & = \qty(\sum_{i=0}^m x^i)\qty(\frac{1}{1-(\sum_{i=1}^k x^i)(\sum_{i=1}^m x^i)})\qty(\sum_{i=0}^k x^i)                     \\

          Notice that $\frac{1}{1-3x^2} = \sum 3^n x^{2n}$.
          If $n$ is even, then we have $3^{n/2}+ 2(0) + 3^{n/2-1} = 4\cdot 3^{\floor{n/2}-1}$.

  Therefore, if we let $C(x) = x^3$, we have by Theorem 3.26 that

        \begin{sol}
          Observe that 0101 only overlaps itself as $(0101)(01)$.
          The set of suffixes to consider is $\{01\}$
          with generating series $C(x) = x^2$.
          Therefore, by Theorem 3.26,

  Let $\rx S = \rx A^* \rx B$ be an unambiguous prefix decomposition
  producing some set of strings $\rl S \subseteq \{0,1\}^*$.
  Show that the recursion $\rx{R = B \smile A R}$ defines an expression $\rx R$

  Also check that both $\rx S$ and $\rx R$ lead to the rational function $B(x)/(1 - A(x))$
\end{xca}
\begin{prf}
  Let $\rl S_n = \rl A^n \rl B$.
  By definition, $\rl S = \bigcup_{n\geq 0} \rl S_n$
  and because of unambiguity, this is a disjoint union.

  Now, consider the set produced by $\rx R$.
  Produce a disjoint union based on the number of times $m$ we choose to recurse
  (i.e., choose $\rx{AR}$) before terminating (i.e., choosing $\rx{B}$).
  Then, $\rl R_m = \rl A^m \rl B = \rl S_m$.
  Therefore, the set produced is $\bigcup_{n\geq 0} \rl R_n = \bigcup_{n\geq 0} \rl S_n = \rl S$.

  For the generating series, notice that we can write $S(x) = \frac{1}{1-A(x)}\cdot B(x)
    = \frac{B(x)}{1-A(x)}$ and $R(x) = B(x) + A(x)R(x)
    \implies R(x)(1-A(x)) = B(x) \implies R(x) = \frac{B(x)}{1-A(x)}$
